# StudyBooster
## Purpose of this Web Application

StudyBooster makes the tedoius process of calculating SPI(Semester Performace Index) and PPI(Progressive Performance Index) easy.In Studybooster students can add their estimated marks in each
subject of each component to get an estimate of their S.P.I. and
also get an exact S.P.I. by inputting grades of each subject.Studentâ€™s marks of every component of every subject are saved
in Studybooster hence he/she can review at any moment from
any device and can also make changes to get a new estimate of
S.P.I. instantly.
